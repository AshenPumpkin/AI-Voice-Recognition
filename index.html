            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p><strong>Final project</strong> - Our final project is an AI system designed to detect whether a voice file is genuine or generated using deepfake technology (Ai Voice Recognize - AVR). Its purpose is to provide a safety layer to protect people from scams and to verify using voice authentication. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in its development, along with the use of Mel Spectrogram for audio signal processing.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</strong></p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. While popular culture often depicts AI as androids like C3PO or advanced spaceship computers, modern AI is primarily based on statistical algorithms that utilize mathematical models to analyze data and make predictions. AI technology has various applications, including natural language processing (such as chatbots), image generation (like DALL-E), and voice and video synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>What is Deepfake?</strong></p>
            <p>Deepfake refers to the use of artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep learning algorithms, to create realistic fake content, typically videos or images. In deepfake videos, a person's likeness and voice can be manipulated to make it appear as though they are saying or doing something they never did in reality. This technology raises concerns about its potential misuse for spreading misinformation, defamation, and other malicious purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>What is a Spoof?</strong></p>
            <p>A spoof is a type of fraudulent activity where someone impersonates another individual or entity, usually using their voice or image. In the context of voice recognition, a spoof attack involves obtaining enough samples of a person's voice and then using AI to analyze and create a profile for that voice. This allows the attacker to generate synthetic audio that mimics the target's voice, enabling them to manipulate voice-based authentication systems or create fake audio recordings. Addressing the threat of spoof attacks is a crucial issue in voice recognition technology, and our project aims to tackle this challenge by developing robust AI algorithms for voice authentication and verification.</p>

            <p><strong>How does Voice Recognition Work?</strong></p>
            <p>Voice recognition, also known as speech recognition, is a technology that enables computers to interpret and understand human speech. It involves converting spoken words into text or commands that a computer can process. Voice recognition systems use a combination of techniques, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning, to analyze audio input and identify the words spoken by the user. These systems can then perform various tasks based on the recognized speech, such as transcribing spoken words into text, controlling devices through voice commands, or providing interactive responses.</p>

            <p><strong>What are the Applications of Voice Recognition?</strong></p>
            <p>Voice recognition technology has numerous applications across various industries and sectors. Some common examples include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use voice recognition to understand and respond to user commands, such as setting reminders, answering questions, and controlling smart home devices.</li>
              <li><strong>Dictation Software:</strong> Voice recognition software allows users to dictate text instead of typing, making it useful for tasks like transcribing documents, composing emails, or writing reports.</li>
              <li><strong>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Systems:</strong> Many customer service helplines and automated phone systems use voice recognition to understand and respond to caller inquiries, allowing users to navigate menus and access information using spoken commands.</li>
              <li><strong>Voice Biometrics:</strong> Voice recognition technology can also be used for biometric authentication and verification purposes, where a person's voice is used as a unique identifier for identity verification and access control.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How Secure is Voice Recognition?</strong></p>
            <p>Voice recognition technology offers a convenient and user-friendly way to interact with devices and systems, but its security depends on various factors. While voice biometrics can provide robust authentication and verification mechanisms, they are not immune to spoofing attacks or other forms of manipulation. Developers must implement additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, continuous authentication, and anti-spoofing techniques, to enhance the security of voice recognition systems and protect against fraudulent activities.</p>
