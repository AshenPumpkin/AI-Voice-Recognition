AI Voice Recognize üéôÔ∏è

Overview:
The AI Voice Recognize project is a collaborative effort by Guy Ben Ari and Ynon Friedman, fourth-year students at Afeka College of Engineering. The project focuses on developing a sophisticated system for detecting spoofed audio files, distinguishing them from genuine human voices. By employing cutting-edge techniques in machine learning and signal processing, our goal is to provide a robust solution for automatic speaker verification systems.

Dataset:
The project utilizes datasets such as ASVspoof2019, a benchmark dataset widely used in the field of audio spoofing detection. This dataset offers a diverse range of real human voice recordings and spoofed audio files, enabling comprehensive training and evaluation of our model.

Approach:
We employ a neural network architecture combining LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequential audio data processing and Conv2D layers for feature extraction from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) images. By concatenating these features and employing fully connected layers for classification, our model aims to accurately distinguish between real and spoofed audio files.

Development Environment:
The project is developed using JupyterLab Notebook for model prototyping and training. We leverage Git for version control, enabling seamless collaboration and tracking of project changes.

Integration into Product:
The trained model is integrated into a product developed in PyCharm, providing real-time or batch inference capabilities on audio files. Extensive testing ensures the reliability and performance of the product in real-world scenarios.
